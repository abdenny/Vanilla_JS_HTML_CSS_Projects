# Javascript Projects 

#### All projects in this repo were created only using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. 
We often take advantage of the robust resources we have in front-end development like CSS frameworks (Bootstrap 4,  Tailwind, etc.), JS libraries and frameworks  (React, Angular & Vue). However, there is still great value in creating vanilla projects. It's essential to have in-depth knowledge of these keystone technologies to become a successful web developer.
